# Everybody Study Club

Hello, it's your friend [vrk](https://github.com/vrk)! I'm creating a club for folks who are out of school but want to continue to learn, particularly through **side projects** and **independent study**.

We're going to launch an experimental virtual study club on Discord sometime in March 2021! _(...or maybe April, we'll see.)_

Interested in joining? Want to help me run i? Or just want to hear updates?

âœ¨ [Fill out the interest form](https://forms.gle/TBnHtxim8517Q8jT9)! âœ¨

You'll get general updates on the project and will be notified when the Discord is ready to join.

## Coming March 2021: Everybody Study Hall on Discord

For the first version of Everybody Study Club, I want to try to emulate a **Drop-In Tutoring Center** with a few tweaks:

- This will be an **online study hall** for people who are _not_ students, but still want to study or work on side projects.
- We'll have a study hall schedule, which will be the time to come on the Discord and lurk in the text or voice chat while you work on whatever you want.
- During study hall, people will be able to ask questions in Discord to "TAs," i.e. experts on the subject you're studying
- For the "TAs", we will hang and answer questions, but during downtime, we'll also work on whatever we'd like.

We're going to try this out **on [Discord](http://discord.com/)** to start! We'll probably make this a ~5 week experiement, after which we'll get feedback and see if we want to continue or make changes.

Sound interesting? ðŸŒŸ **[Fill out the interest form](https://forms.gle/TBnHtxim8517Q8jT9)** ðŸŒŸ and we'll email you when the Discord is ready to join!!

## Why a Study Hall approach?

IRL, Drop-in Tutoring Centers are great for both students and TAs alike.

When I was a student, it was nice to do my homework in the drop-in tutoring centers. It was easy to focus in a productive environment, I could make friends with other students in the tutoring center, and I knew if I needed help, I could get help right away from a friendly TA.

When I was a TA working at a drop-in tutoring center, it was really fulfilling work that also required very little prep ahead of time. It was low-pressure because I never worked alone, so if if I couldn't answer a student's question, I could always ask another tutor for help. On top of that, on slow days, I could use that time to do my own homework, or read a book, or chat with the other tutors.

Based on the initial response to the esc interest form, most respondees found **motivation** to be the most difficult part about self-studying and personal projects (63% of respondees), followed by the **ability to ask people questions** (32% of respondees).

It seems like something similar to a drop-in tutoring center for folks outside of school might address both of these problems! (Plus, this format requires much less prep for me in comparison to creating and running a course ðŸ˜„)

## Why Discord?

I'd like to be able to hold the study club online, but oof Zoom can be such a stressful space, especially a Zoom full of people who don't know each other very well!

I've really been impressed with Discord and how well it's worked for communities like [TTMIK](https://talktomeinkorean.com/). It also looks like some professors have also used [Discord for office hours](https://profteacher.com/2021/01/05/setting-up-discord-for-office-hours/), utilizing both the text chat and voice chat features. Discord is also free!

It seems like a good platform to start with! We'll give Discord a try for a month or two and then we can reassess.
