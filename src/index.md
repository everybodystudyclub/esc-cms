# Everybody Study Club

Hello, it's your friend [vrk](https://github.com/vrk). I want to teach people how to build things on the web.

I taught a [web programming course](https://github.com/yayinternet/cs193x-course) a few years ago, and for a while I've wanted to make a free online version of it. This year I might finally do it.

If I do, then I also want to tinker and experiment with the format of online learning. Few of the current models work well for anyone, so let's see if there aren't ways we can improve upon them.

Would you be interested in taking my class or class-like thing? Want to help me with it? Or just want to hear updates?

✨ [Fill out my interest form](https://comingsoon)! ✨

I'd love to hear from you! You can expect to hear from me in Feb or March 2021.

## A little more

Self-studying is really hard. There's an entire sea of material out there, but it's well-known that e.g. MOOCs have a [poor completion rate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2020/06/21/the-depressing-and-disheartening-news-about-moocs/?sh=3c7981cb76ed). It's hard to find the time and it's hard to stay motivated.

As a quarantine pastime, I started studying Korean again. It's been going shockingly well, and I think it's because I've stumbled upon some really great techniques from this community around self-studying.

Language learning best practices have changed a bit, at least since I last studied seriously. The idea that one has to be physically "immersed" in a country to become fluent in the language is now understood to be false, and instead there is an emphasis on **slow and steady** learning. Just put in the time. Quantity over quality.

There is also an emphasis on **small community** within the larger community. Language partners, community tutors, classes of 5-10 people are all strongly encouraged. (You never see 100-person lecture sizes for a Spanish class.)

As a result, I've been studying Korean consistently since April 2020, keeping up with it even with a demanding work schedule. This is easily the longest I've ever stuck with a learning endeavor outside of school or work demands. Surely quarantine has something to do with it, but I don't actually think it's the main factor. I think it's the approach.

I recently left my last job and I've got a few months of free time before my next gig. I'd love to spend of that time tinkering with online learning, and see whether I can incorporate some of these techniques (and others!) in some sort of class-like offering that teaches people how to build things on the web. It might work, it might not. But I want to try it out.

If that sounds interesting to you in any way, please [fill out the interest form](https://comingsoon)! Filling out the form in no way commits you to anything; it'll just help me figure out my offering.
