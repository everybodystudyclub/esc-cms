After reviewing the initial response to the [interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgCBc-oIJ1XP1lcz3RBon0bTsXmacBe1ToZn9_ipUEBvHmpQ/viewform), as well as doing some self-reflection on how much time I can devote to this sustainably ðŸ˜„, I've decided to go with a Study Hall format on Discord!!

More details on the homepage: [everybodystudy.club](https://www.everybodystudy.club/)

Going to get some housekeeping together, convince a few friends to be my initial TAs and mods, then will launch the Discord sometime this month!

As with before, fill out the [interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgCBc-oIJ1XP1lcz3RBon0bTsXmacBe1ToZn9_ipUEBvHmpQ/viewform) to get updates and to hear when the Discord is open!
