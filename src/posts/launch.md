The site is live and the interest form is live!

✨📝 **[Fill out the form!!](https://forms.gle/TBnHtxim8517Q8jT9)** 📝✨

I'm curious to see what the response is like. Maybe I'll get few responses, in which case I'll probably focus more on providing async resources versus a live offering. Or if I get a lot of responses, it'd be fun to think of what to do with that too.

Or maybe this website in its current state will be the place where this project ends.

Either way, I'm excited to try this out!
